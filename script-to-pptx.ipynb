I will go over in details what each part of the code does, so that whoever is reading this will know exactly when to use certain parts of the code and when it is not necessary to run code. I will also try and do my best to make this Notebook as non-programmer friendly as possible. Feel free to use this Notebook as a reference to future script conversions!\n","\n","There are five main sections in this Notebook:\n","\n","> **Section 1:** This section basically sets up the rest of the Notebook so that code can run. Make sure you run this first before running any of the other sections!\n","\n","> **Section 2:** This section will take a PDF of images of the script and convert them into actual images that we can use in Section 3. You do not need to run this section if you are given an actual script with highlightable words. You also do not need to run this section if you have already ran it before.\n","\n","> **Section 3:** This section takes the images from Section 2 and converts the images into highlightable text in .txt files (one .txt file for each image). Again, you do not need to run this section if you are given an actual script with highlightable words, but if you ran Section 2, you MUST run this section as well. Also, you do not need to run this section if you have already ran it before.\n","\n","> **Section 4:** This section is more about ensuring that Section 3 works properly. When all of the .txt files created using Section 3 have been corrected and finalized so that no more changes to the script will be made, run this section to combine all of the .txt files into one giant .txt file. This section should only be ran if you ran Section 2 and 3. You may want to run this section many times if there are changes and revisions to the script; otherwise just make the changes manually.\n","\n","> **Section 5:** This section will take the giant .txt file containing the entire script and create a PowerPoint from it. This section can be run directly if you already have a giant .txt file of the entire script in a parsable format.\n","\n","To summarize when to go through what sections:\n","\n","> If you are given a PDF of images of the script, you will need to go through all of the sections.\n","\n","> If you are given a PDF of highlightable text of the script, then simply copy and paste the text directly into a .txt file, then go through Section 1 and 5. (You could also go through all of the sections if you'd like just to separate each page into a .txt file for organization/revision purposes; however, this is probably not the move and you're probably better off just manually making revisions in the overarching .txt file.) \n","\n","> If you are given a .txt file of the entire script in a parsable format, then you only need to go through Section 1 and 5.\n","\n","If you are confused as to whether or not you should go through a section, just look at the note that I have made at the bottom of each section.\n","\n","Finally, there may be some things in the code that you will need to change according to your circumstance. I have left comments in the code that tell you what you need to change, and each section should also tell you which variables may need to be adjust to get the desired outcome.\n","\n","**NOTE:** I cannot guarantee that this will work in Jupyter Notebook, as I have only ran this code using Google Colab.
